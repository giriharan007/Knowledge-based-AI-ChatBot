# Knowledge Based Chatbot

The knowledge base AI chatbot is designed to provide users with accurate and relevant information based on their queries. It leverages the difflib library in Python to perform fuzzy string matching, allowing it to find the closest matches to user input even if there are slight variations or misspellings.

Key Features:

Fuzzy String Matching: The chatbot uses the difflib library to compare user queries with entries in its knowledge base. This enables the chatbot to handle spelling errors, typos, and variations in user input, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly experience.

Data Storage in JSON Format: The knowledge base is stored in a JSON file, which organizes information in a structured format. Each entry in the JSON file contains key-value pairs representing different aspects of the knowledge base, such as questions and corresponding answers.

Query Processing: When a user submits a query, the chatbot reads the JSON file to retrieve relevant information. It then uses fuzzy string matching to find the closest matching entries to the user's query.

Response Generation: Once the closest matches are identified, the chatbot generates responses based on the matched entries from the knowledge base. It presents the information to the user in a clear and concise manner, providing answers to their questions or guiding them to relevant resources.

User Interaction: The chatbot interacts with users in a conversational manner, prompting them for clarification if their queries are ambiguous or unclear. It aims to understand the user's intent and provide helpful responses tailored to their needs.

Scalability and Maintenance: Since the knowledge base is stored in a JSON file, it is easily scalable and maintainable. New entries can be added or existing ones updated without significant changes to the underlying infrastructure.

Benefits:

Improved User Experience: The fuzzy string matching capability enhances the chatbot's ability to understand user input accurately, leading to a smoother and more intuitive interaction.
Efficient Information Retrieval: By storing information in a structured format and leveraging fuzzy matching techniques, the chatbot can quickly retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base, saving users time and effort.
Flexibility and Adaptability: The chatbot's architecture allows for easy adaptation to changing user needs and updates to the knowledge base content. It can evolve over time to better serve its users and accommodate new information.
